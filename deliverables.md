## D1: Analysis and design report

The initial foundational output of the USCE2QC project. Its primary purpose is to detail the comprehensive analysis and design phases undertaken during the first five months of the project, specifically focusing on the activities within Work Package 2 (QC Node Dependability via Ultrastrong Coupling Regime) and Work Package 3 (QC Infrastructure Dependability via the Edge-to-Quantum (E2Q) Computing Continuum). This report lays out the theoretical underpinnings, design specifications, and initial conceptualizations that will guide the subsequent development and validation phases of the project, providing a clear roadmap for achieving the stated objectives.

## D2: Initial development report

A key milestone in the USCE2QC project. Its primary purpose is to document and report on the initial progress of the implementation and development activities carried out since the completion of the “Analysis and Design Report” (D1) at Month 5. This report provides a detailed account of the first version of the solutions, models, and techniques developed within Work Package 2 (QC Node Dependability via Ultrastrong Coupling Regime) and Work Package 3 (QC Infrastructure Dependability via the Edge-to-Quantum (E2Q) Computing Continuum). It highlights the initial results, challenges encountered, and the overall trajectory of the project's development phase, ensuring a transparent and verifiable record of progress.

## D3: Final Development Report

A crucial and concluding milestone in the USCE2QC project's development phase. Its primary purpose is to provide a comprehensive and definitive account of the final implementation of all solutions, models, and artifacts. This report details the final, mature versions of the technical outputs from Work Package 2 (QC Node Dependability via Ultrastrong Coupling Regime) and Work Package 3 (QC Infrastructure Dependability via the Edge-to-Quantum (E2Q) Computing Continuum). It serves as the culmination of the work initiated in D1 and reported on in D2, presenting the complete and integrated solutions that are ready for validation.

## D4: Validation Report

The final and conclusive technical report for the USCE2QC project. Its primary purpose is to provide a comprehensive and rigorous account of the validation activities conducted on all project artifacts—the models, techniques, and solutions—developed in previous project phases (D1, D2, and D3). This report objective is to demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and dependability of the proposed solutions through specific tests, simulations, and comparative analyses. By doing so, it verifies that the USCE2QC project has successfully achieved its goals of advancing the state-of-the-art in quantum computing dependability at both the node and infrastructure levels.
