title: A Holistic Approach to Quantum Computing Dependability: From Noise Suppression in Ultrastrong Coupling Regime to the Edge-to-Quantum Continuum
---

The USCE2Q project aims at significantly contributing to the development of dependable/fault tolerant quantum computers in the NISQ era, by addressing related challenges from a holistic viewpoint, at both node and distributed infrastructure levels. It leverages the ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime to improve QC node-level dependability and explores the Edge-to-Quantum (E2Q) continuum for enhanced hybrid (classical-quantum) infrastructure dependability.

# Main objectives

The **main objectives** of USCE2Q are: 
- i) implement proactive and reactive solutions for node-level dependability via USC; 
- ii) design and deploy E2Q architectures, offloading mechanisms, and dependability policies.

To achieve such goals, a multifaceted, trans-/inter-/multi-disciplinary methodology combining theoretical, practical, and simulation-based approaches will be adopted.

Quantitative methodologies, metrics and models for the assessment of QC system dependability, including analytical, simulation and machine learning techniques will be explored, adapted, refined and extended. Proactive (noise suppression, faster and more reliable gates) and reactive (quantum error detection/correction protocols) approaches to improve the QC node dependability will be investigated, harnessing entangled states and virtual photon dressing in the ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime. Hybrid classical-quantum computing architectures, patterns and schemes towards the Edge-to-Quantum (E2Q) continuum will be investigated and further elaborated for QC system distributed infrastructure dependability.

# Results

This effort **resulted** in 
- i) proactive and reactive solutions for noise suppression and error correction, including fast-reliable gates, in the USC regime to deal with QC node dependability; and 
- ii) E2Q architecture, offloading mechanisms, and policies for dependable and secure QC infrastructure. Such results will innovate and impact on the state-of-the-art in QC dependability paving the way for fault-tolerant quantum computing, while contributing to the development of sustainable and green QC technologies, and providing a framework of metrics, models and techniques for QC dependability assessment.

Thereby, USCE2Q is aligned with this call research program, mainly addressing hardware and middleware challenges and issues in the development of reliable and dependable QC systems at node and infrastructure levels, in assessing and benchmarking as well as in controlling and monitoring QC systems.

# Highlights
